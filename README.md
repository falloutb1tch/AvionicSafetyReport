# The plane, boss, the plane!
## Overview
Our team has been asked to quantify the safety of airplane makes/models in relation to purchasing decisions and further impact on the commpany after that decision is made.
## Business Understanding
We must provide visualizations and data support to show our company why the "most dangerous" airplane models are as such, as well as any other tangential information as relates to airplane crashes and the safety of particular makes/models that our company might be interested in purchasing now or in future.
## Data Understanding
## Data Preparation (Can be really short in README)
Our team went through the data and ensured that it met our standards. As an example, we focused on standardizing entries and ensuring that NaN values were removed so that our data was accurate and useful.
