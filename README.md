# The plane, boss, the plane!
## Overview
Our team has been asked to quantify the safety of airplane makes/models in relation to purchasing decisions and further impact on the commpany after that decision is made.
## Business Understanding
We must provide visualizations and data support to show our company why the "most dangerous" airplane models are as such, as well as any other tangential information as relates to airplane crashes and the safety of particular makes/models that our company might be interested in purchasing now or in future.
## Data Understanding
We explored and began the process of standardizing and organizing data correctly so that we could move through the data cleaning and analysis portions smoothly.
## Data Preparation (Can be really short in README)
Our team went through the data and ensured that it met our standards. As an example, we focused on standardizing entries and ensuring that NaN values were removed so that our data was accurate and useful.
## Analysis and Results/Recommendations
Our analysis indicated that whilst Boeing is a solid and safe choice to purchase a plane from, Beech is absolutely not. As a further recommendation, Alaska should be avoided when considering aviary paths for business purposes.
## Conlusion and Next Steps
After exploring, preparing, cleaning and analyzing the given avionics data, our team feels very comfortable recommending Boeing as a favorable purchasing option. Furthermore, we are very certain that purchasing an airplane from Beech is advised under absolutely no circumstances. Finally, expanding our avionics business to Alaska would be a mistake at this time.
